evlog includes agent skills that help AI assistants review your logging patterns and guide evlog adoption.

## What are Agent Skills?

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) is an open specification for packaging AI assistant capabilities. Skills provide:

- **Domain knowledge**: Best practices for wide events and structured errors
- **Code review**: Identify logging anti-patterns in your codebase
- **Guided adoption**: Step-by-step help migrating to evlog

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `skills/evlog` | Review code for logging patterns, suggest evlog adoption, guide wide event design |

## Installing the Skill

Compatible agents (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) can discover and use skills automatically.

To manually install with the skills CLI:

```bash [Terminal]
npx skills add hugorcd/evlog
```

## What the Skill Does

### Code Review

The skill analyzes your codebase for:

- **Scattered logging**: Multiple `console.log` or `logger.info` calls in request handlers
- **Missing context**: Logs without user, request, or business context
- **Unhelpful errors**: `throw new Error()` without structured fields
- **Correlation gaps**: Missing request IDs or trace IDs

### Adoption Guidance

The skill helps you:

- Convert traditional logging to wide events
- Design effective wide event schemas
- Implement structured errors with `why`, `fix`, and `link`
- Set up evlog in Nuxt, Nitro, or standalone TypeScript

### Example Prompts

Ask your AI assistant:

```
Review this file for logging anti-patterns
```

```
Help me convert these console.log calls to a wide event
```

```
What context should I add to this wide event?
```

```
How do I structure this error with evlog?
```

## Reference Documents

The skill includes reference documents that provide:

### wide-events.md

- Wide event anatomy and best practices
- Context grouping patterns
- Output format examples

### structured-errors.md

- Error field definitions
- Status code guidelines
- Frontend integration patterns

- Common anti-patterns to identify
- Migration suggestions

## Creating Custom Skills

You can extend evlog's skills or create your own for team-specific patterns:

```markdown [skills/my-team/SKILL.md]
# My Team Logging Skill

Extends evlog skill with team-specific guidelines.

## References
- @evlog/skills/evlog

## Custom Patterns
- Always include `team` field in wide events
- Use `X-Team-Request-Id` header for correlation
- Log to DataDog with structured format
```
