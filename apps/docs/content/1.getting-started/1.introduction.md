**evlog** is a TypeScript logging library that replaces scattered log lines with comprehensive wide events and structured errors.

Inspired by [Logging Sucks](https://loggingsucks.com/) by [Boris Tane](https://x.com/boristane).

## Philosophy

Traditional logging is broken. Your logs are scattered across dozens of files. Each request generates 10+ log lines. When something goes wrong, you're left grep-ing through noise hoping to find signal.

**evlog** takes a different approach:

::card-group
  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-layers
  title: Wide Events
  ---
  One comprehensive log event per request, containing all the context you need.
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-shield-alert
  title: Structured Errors
  ---
  Errors that explain why they occurred and how to fix them.
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-git-branch
  title: Request Scoping
  ---
  Accumulate context throughout the request lifecycle, emit once at the end.

  Human-readable in development, machine-parseable JSON in production.

## What are Wide Events?

Instead of scattering logs throughout your code:

```typescript [Traditional logging]
logger.info('Request started')
logger.info('User authenticated', { userId: user.id })
logger.info('Fetching cart', { cartId: cart.id })
logger.info('Processing payment')
logger.info('Payment successful')
logger.info('Request completed')
```

You accumulate context and emit once:

::code-group
```typescript [Code]
// server/api/checkout.post.ts
const log = useLogger(event)

log.set({ user: { id: 1, plan: 'pro' } })
log.set({ cart: { id: 42, items: 3, total: 9999 } })
log.set({ payment: { method: 'card', status: 'success' } })

return { success: true }
```
```bash [Output]
[INFO] POST /api/checkout (234ms)
  user: { id: 1, plan: 'pro' }
  cart: { id: 42, items: 3, total: 9999 }
  payment: { method: 'card', status: 'success' }
  status: 200
```
::

One log, all context. Everything you need to understand what happened during that request.

## Structured Errors

Traditional errors are opaque:

```typescript
throw new Error('Payment failed')
```

Structured errors provide actionable context:

::code-group
```typescript [Code]
// server/api/checkout.post.ts
throw createError({
  message: 'Payment failed',
  status: 402,
  why: 'Card declined by issuer (insufficient funds)',
  fix: 'Try a different payment method or contact your bank',
  link: 'https://docs.example.com/payments/declined',
})
```
```json [Response]
{
  "statusCode": 402,
  "message": "Payment failed",
  "data": {
    "why": "Card declined by issuer (insufficient funds)",
    "fix": "Try a different payment method or contact your bank",
    "link": "https://docs.example.com/payments/declined"
  }
}
```
::

With `why`, `fix`, and `link` fields, anyone debugging—human or AI—can immediately understand the root cause and how to resolve it.

## Why Context Matters

We're entering an era where AI agents build, debug, and maintain applications. These agents need **structured context** to work effectively:

- **`why`**: The root cause, so the agent understands what went wrong
- **`fix`**: An actionable solution the agent can suggest or apply
- **`link`**: Documentation for complex issues

Traditional `console.log` and generic `throw new Error()` provide no actionable context. evlog's structured output is designed for both humans and AI to parse and act on.
