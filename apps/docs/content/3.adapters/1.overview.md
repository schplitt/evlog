Adapters let you send logs to external observability platforms. evlog provides built-in adapters for popular services, and you can create custom adapters for any destination.

## How Adapters Work

Adapters hook into the `evlog:drain` event, which fires after each request completes. The drain runs in **fire-and-forget** mode, meaning it never blocks the HTTP response.

```typescript [server/plugins/evlog-drain.ts]
import { createAxiomDrain } from 'evlog/axiom'

export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
  nitroApp.hooks.hook('evlog:drain', createAxiomDrain())
})
```

## Multiple Destinations

Send logs to multiple services simultaneously:

```typescript [server/plugins/evlog-drain.ts]
import { createAxiomDrain } from 'evlog/axiom'
import { createOTLPDrain } from 'evlog/otlp'

export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
  const axiom = createAxiomDrain()
  const otlp = createOTLPDrain()

  nitroApp.hooks.hook('evlog:drain', async (ctx) => {
    await Promise.allSettled([axiom(ctx), otlp(ctx)])
  })
})
```

## Drain Context

Every adapter receives a `DrainContext` with:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event` | `WideEvent` | The complete log event with all accumulated context |
| `request` | `object` | Request metadata (`method`, `path`, `requestId`) |
| `headers` | `object` | Safe HTTP headers (sensitive headers are filtered) |

**Security:** Sensitive headers (`authorization`, `cookie`, `x-api-key`, etc.) are automatically filtered and never passed to adapters.
::

## Zero-Config Setup

All adapters support automatic configuration via environment variables. No code changes needed when deploying to different environments:

```bash [.env]
# Axiom
NUXT_AXIOM_TOKEN=xaat-xxx
NUXT_AXIOM_DATASET=my-logs

# OTLP
NUXT_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.example.com
```

```typescript [server/plugins/evlog-drain.ts]
import { createAxiomDrain } from 'evlog/axiom'

export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
  // Automatically reads from env vars
  nitroApp.hooks.hook('evlog:drain', createAxiomDrain())
})
```
