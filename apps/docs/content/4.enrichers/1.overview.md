Enrichers add derived context to your wide events after they are emitted, before they reach your drain adapters. Use them to automatically extract useful information from request headers without cluttering your application code.

## How Enrichers Work

Enrichers hook into the `evlog:enrich` event, which fires after a wide event is emitted and before the `evlog:drain` hook. The enricher receives the event and request metadata, and can mutate the event to add derived fields.

```
Request → emit() → evlog:enrich → evlog:drain
                    ↑ enrichers      ↑ adapters
                    add context      send to services
```

```typescript [server/plugins/evlog-enrich.ts]
import { createUserAgentEnricher, createGeoEnricher } from 'evlog/enrichers'

export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
  const enrichers = [
    createUserAgentEnricher(),
    createGeoEnricher(),
  ]

  nitroApp.hooks.hook('evlog:enrich', (ctx) => {
    for (const enricher of enrichers) enricher(ctx)
  })
})
```

## Enrich Context

Every enricher receives an `EnrichContext` with:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event` | `WideEvent` | The emitted wide event (mutable) |
| `request` | `object` | Request metadata (`method`, `path`, `requestId`) |
| `headers` | `object` | Safe HTTP request headers (sensitive headers are filtered) |
| `response` | `object` | Response metadata (`status`, `headers`) |

**Security:** Sensitive headers (`authorization`, `cookie`, `x-api-key`, etc.) are automatically filtered and never passed to enrichers.

## Overwrite Behavior

By default, enrichers preserve existing fields. If your application code already sets `event.userAgent`, the enricher won't overwrite it. Pass `{ overwrite: true }` to change this:

```typescript
createUserAgentEnricher({ overwrite: true })
```
